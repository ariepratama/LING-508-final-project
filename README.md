# NESPew (Named Entity Search Portal from News, a UA LING-508 Final Project)

## Introduction
Hi! this is basically a prototype web application that will simply show web to search for named entity in indexed news.


## Quickstart on your local
1. Make sure you have installed docker and docker-compose in your desktop
2. (Optional) create a new virtual env by either `conda` or `venv`
3. Do `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Fire `docker-compose up` to get the mysql database up
5. Do `python app.py`, upon successful startup, the API will be up at localhost:5002
6. Open `web/main.html` in your browser and start typing in the search box.
